# FubuMVC Contrib #

This is a Contrib project for FubuMVC


**NOTE**: FubuMVC's primary source is now being hosted on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/darthfubumvc/fubumvc)

FubuMVC is a _Front Controller_-style MVC framework designed primarily for Web applications built on ASP.NET (though it can be used for other non-web, non-ASP.NET purposes).

## For us, by us ##

Fubu is an acronym which means "For us, by us."  After using the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Beta framework and disagreeing with some of the design choices made therein, several of us decided to try to bend it to our design choices using its extensibility points.  Eventually we reached our goal, but we realized we had overrode or replaced large portions of the MVC framework.  At this point, it was suggested that maybe we take it one step further and write our own MVC framework starting at the same layer where ASP.NET MVC begins.  This is the realization of that suggestion.


_To be clear: This framework is NOT based on the ASP.NET MVC Framework at all. It is inspired by it, however._
