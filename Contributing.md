# Contributing to FubuMVC Contrib #

Contributors to this project should keep one thing in mind and that is it should work with the trunk version or a released version of FubuMVC framework. Meaning we would appreciate you not to check in a different version of the FubuMVC framework code. The main reason for this is that it needs to serve as an example as well and if you have specific stuff in there new users might not see that.

Now there are also other things except from example site that you might want to contribute like different behaviors.

Having said that, we don't want to discourage you from contributing so if you do have something special that needed adjustments to the FubuMVC framework, make sure it is clearly visible. and let us know, we might want to add it to the core.
